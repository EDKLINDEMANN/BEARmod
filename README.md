# BEARmod
Basic Epidemic, Activity, and Response COVID-19 model

This model implements a basic SEIR simulation model, accounting for variable daily movement patterns, recovery rates, and contact rates. The timestep defaults to daily, but can be changed to better approximate continuous time. See "bearmod_fx.R" and "updates and notes.txt" for more details for now.

For a placeholder dummy dataset and example simulation run, please see "run_model_small.R", which uses a dummy movement dataset "testmove.csv"
