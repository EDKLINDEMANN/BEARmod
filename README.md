# BEARmod
Basic Epidemic, Activity, and Response COVID-19 model

This model implements a basic SEIR model with a daily time step, accounting for variable daily movement patterns, recovery rates, and contact rates. See bearmod_fx.R for more details for now.

For a placeholder dummy dataset and example simulation run, please see "run_model_small.R", which uses a dummy movement dataset "testmove.csv"
